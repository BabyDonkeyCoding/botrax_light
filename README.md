## Functionality
Your can configure the bot by adjusting the settings in the JSON file. The templates folder will include all examples you need.
## Purpose
Work on this project is for educational purposes only!
## Supporters
I made a lot of improvements over the last months, but could not have done it without my clan and close friends who are playing with me on a daily basis.
All of these guys are raw rebels like myself :D
